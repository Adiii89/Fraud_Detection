# Retail Cash Counter Fraud Detection

## Overview:
•Initialization: First, we initialize the POS(Point-of-Sale) system and create a database to store scanned and detected items.
•Object detection: We use a deep learning model called YOLO to detect objects in videos.
•Study: For each video stream frame, we use the YOLO model to identify products and display their text and trust scores.
•Update detected objects: When an object is detected, we update the system's file of detected objects.
•Comparison: Once the checkout process is completed, we provide a product review for the scanned item.
•Recommendation: As a comparison, we guide you to verify whether the detected product matches the scanned product. Printed items.

## Additional features we can add are:

### Cashier Behavior Analysis Integration:

•Data Collection: Use security cameras installed at cash registers to record video footage of cashiers while they work.
•Pre-Processing: Pre-processing video data to remove frames and isolate the receiver area that is the return (ROI).
•Behavior Recognition Model: Introduce a separate model, such as deep learning models or computer vision, to identify the receiver's body language and foot-hand movements.
•Alarm mechanism: Integrate an alarm system to alert store management or security personnel when activity is detected. This can be done via email notification, SMS notification, or event notification.
•Feedback: Continue to update and improve the behavior analysis model based on feedback and real data to increase accuracy and reduce bias.

#### Limitations to consider:
•Multiple items on one invoice: The system might raise a false alarm if multiple items are sold under one invoice, especially if the invoice isn't always placed next to the product.
•Hidden items: If a stolen item is concealed, the computer vision system couldn't detect it.
•Blurry footage or obstructions: Low-quality camera footage or obstructions in the view can hinder the model's ability to detect objects and activities accurately.
